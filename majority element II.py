'''
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times. The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

'''
'''
Idea:
randomly remove 3 different numbers, if a number appears more than n/3 times, it must be left, while a number left does not mean it is 
majority, need to check whether the result is correct (e.g. 1,2,3,1,2,3,4 notice that there maybe no solution at all)

The code above is a little redundant, we can make it more concise
